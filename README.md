In an effort to maximize simplicity and ease of use as well as provide maximum efficiency, we have made a three in one flutter application that includes Diary, Expense Manager and Reminders.

## Getting Started
 On the first screen you are required to login so we can securely store all your data on the cloud and you can see your diary and expense entries even on another device
